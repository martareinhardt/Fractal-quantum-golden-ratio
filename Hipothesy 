# Fractal Quantum Golden Ratio

This project explores the hypothesis that the fractal quantum golden ratio may be the origin of all other patterns in the universe. The goal is to support modern physics in understanding and unifying theories about the origin of the universe.

## About

- **Main Language:** Python
- **Status:** Under development
- **Purpose:** Investigate fractal patterns and the golden ratio in quantum contexts, searching for possible connections to universal phenomena.
